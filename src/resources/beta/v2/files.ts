   * The V2 API enhances security by verifying the entire payload using JWT. This API
   * is in beta.
   *
   * ImageKit.io allows you to upload files directly from both the server and client
   * sides. For server-side uploads, private API key authentication is used. For
   * client-side uploads, generate a one-time `token` from your secure backend using
   * private API.
   * [Learn more](/docs/api-reference/upload-file/upload-file-v2#how-to-implement-secure-client-side-file-upload)
   * about how to implement secure client-side file upload.
   *
   * **File size limit** \
   * On the free plan, the maximum upload file sizes are 20MB for images, audio, and raw
   * files, and 100MB for videos. On the paid plan, these limits increase to 40MB for
   * images, audio, and raw files, and 2GB for videos. These limits can be further increased
   * with higher-tier plans.
   *
   * **Version limit** \
   * A file can have a maximum of 100 versions.
   *
   * **Demo applications**
   *
   * - A full-fledged
   *   [upload widget using Uppy](https://github.com/imagekit-samples/uppy-uploader),
   *   supporting file selections from local storage, URL, Dropbox, Google Drive,
   *   Instagram, and more.
   * - [Quick start guides](/docs/quick-start-guides) for various frameworks and
   *   technologies.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * const response = await client.beta.v2.files.upload({
